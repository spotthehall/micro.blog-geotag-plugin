# micro.blog-map

_Warning: This uses the Title field for coordinates - so not for everybody!_

Not a bean!

Not even a sausage should go into the Title field for the map plugin to work other than coordinates - and well formed ones at that - no white space please. The format should be 54.567,-1.234

Tested with all themes and issues found so far are with the "Lanyon" theme pagination, the "Archie" theme creates gaps in the map tiles and it does not work with "Hyde".

### I have made the Swarm plugin which hopefully will replace this when micro.blog apps embrace the .Params.location_latitude and .Params.location_longitude location API data.
